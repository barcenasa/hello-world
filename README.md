# hello-world
This is my very first attempt at coding. I am brand new and have no clue inkling as to what I am doing. Let's see how this goes....

Hello! My name is Alexander. I am a first year Information Systems major and Real Estate minor at the University of Florida.
My technologies include supply chain managment, logistics, and actuarial sicences. 
My passions and interestes are the Catholic Church, defesne contractors, re-newable energy industry, and movie industries.
Desireable roles are product manager, project manager, and consultant. 

Organzations include: Florida Leadership Academy, Heavner Leadership Challenge (maybe?, awaiting decision), GatorTech, and Catholic Gators. I hope to teach myself skills related to information systems on the side.
This will be an adventture, in which I currently feel lost.

This is it for now, but I will make edits later and perhaps add it to the master!
